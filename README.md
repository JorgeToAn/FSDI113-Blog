# Mini challenge 1

### Create two additional ListViews with the following criteria:
1. The first list view should filter so that it returns only "published" posts.
2. The second list view should filter so that it returns only "archived" posts.


## Additionally:
1. Add an anchor tag to the dropdown list so that only logged in users can access these new features.
2. Users should only see their own posts in these views (meaning, they are the author).
